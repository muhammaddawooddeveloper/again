                                    in its worth, especially with a company match, ensuring a worry-free retirement.
                                    However, reflecting on my journey, I've had over nine jobs, each sparking a new
                                    retirement account, yet none lasted long enough for full vesting and the match

                                    would've opted for Indexed Universal Policies years ago. Unfortunately, I was
                                    unaware of this policy type. I refer to it as the "iPhone" of money because it

                                    multiple accounts; one "Family bank account" does it all. My wife and I own over $2
                                    million in Cash Value life insurance policies for less than $550 a month, and you

                                plummeted by 158 points. Struggling with minimum payments and making no progress, every
                                extra dollar I had went into maintaining a decent credit score. Then, I discovered the
                                option of personal loans using my W-2. Securing a small personal loan allowed me to pay
                                off those credit cards, resulting in a 158-point boost to my credit score. Following
                                this success, I established an S-corp and applied for business cards, ensuring I never
                                let a maxed-out credit card impact my credit again. While having 0% interest personal
                                cards is noteworthy, possessing 0% interest business cards takes financial security to
                                the next level. Picture maxing out a credit card without affecting your credit—that's
                                true security. Let's achieve the same for you."</em>
